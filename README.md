# Power Learn Project - HTML5 Content & Form Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates advanced HTML5 content elements and the creation of a structured, accessible, and validated web form. It showcases lists, tables, media (audio and video), and a complete HTML5 form with built-in validation.

## Features
- **Semantic HTML5 structure**: Uses `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<fieldset>`, and `<footer>` for clear page structure.
- **Lists**: Both ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists for organized content.
- **Tables**: Clear and accessible table with headers and captions for course schedules.
- **Media**: Embedded video and audio with fallback text for browsers that do not support these elements.
- **Form**:  
  - Multiple input types: text, email, tel, select, radio buttons, checkboxes, and textarea  
  - Accessibility: `<label>`s linked to form fields, `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for grouping  
  - HTML5 validation: `required`, `minlength`, `pattern`, and proper input types  
  - User-friendly placeholders and instructions

## Structure
- `enhanced-form.html`: Main HTML file containing all content and the form.
- Sections included:  
  1. **Enhanced HTML5 Content** – lists, table, video, and audio  
  2. **Sign Up Form** – structured and validated user input form  
- Footer with copyright information and back-to-top link.

## How to Use
1. Open `enhanced-form.html` in any web browser.
2. Navigate through content using the navigation links.
3. Fill out the form and test HTML5 validation (e.g., leave required fields empty, enter invalid email or phone formats).

## Accessibility & Usability
- Semantic HTML ensures better screen reader support.
- Proper labeling and grouping of form fields for clarity.
- Keyboard-friendly navigation throughout the page.
- Media includes fallback messages for unsupported browsers.
